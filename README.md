## Getting started
First of all, install [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and check if everything is installed correctly by typing these two commands (their output may be different):
```
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.56.1
$ cargo --version
cargo 1.56.1
```
Then, just run the code by cloning the source and executing `cargo run` command in the root directory:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/MikhailUskin/rust-game-of-life.git
$ cd rust-game-of-life
$ cargo run
```
